SDLC Happy life
	software development life cycle
1) Planning
2) requirement
3) desining
4) development
5) testing
6) deployment --->devops
7) maintainence

This project is about how devops use ci cd pipeline for automation of SDLC
DevOps is a set of practice that combines software development and IT operation. which aims to 
shorten the software life cycle and deliver high quality software continuosly
OPS---> managing and maintaing IT infrastructure 
DEV ----> creating, building, testing 

Automation: Automation is a fundamental principle of DevOps. It involves using tools 
and scripts to automate manual and repetitive tasks, such as code building, testing, deployment,
and infrastructure provisioning. Automation helps increase efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure consistency in processes. 

Here we are using jenkins as an automation tool.
Jenkins is an open-source automation server  It allows developers to automate repetitive tasks and streamline the 
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.

Continuous Integration (CI): Optimizes building, integrating, and testing code within a development environment.
Continuous Delivery (CD): after the testing the cd makes sure that is always in deployable state that is ready for production


Why ci cd well it automates things would have to be done automatically and it finds out error easily 

shorter cycle time this is the speed at which devops team can deliver a functional application
from the moment work begins and also provide values to the end user and it also leads to happy employees and 
it also get to market faster because the code that has to run through the pipeline and now in production
is now making money whereas code sitting on a harddrive does nothing

OOPS 
	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming It helps us to structure our code in an organized way. 
In oop the code is organized around the data(attributes) and the operator(methods) that can be performed on objects

Use of OOP in Python:

Modularity: OOP allows you to break down a large program into smaller, manageable parts (classes). Each class handles a specific aspect of functionality.
Reusability: Once you define a class, you can create multiple objects from it. This reusability reduces redundant code.
Maintainability: OOP promotes clean code organization, making it easier to maintain and debug.
Scalability: As your program grows, OOP helps you add new features by extending existing classes or creating new ones.
Design Patterns: OOP aligns with common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer), making it easier to implement them in Python.

The primary principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

A constructor is a member function of a class that is used to create objects of that class. 
It has the same name as the class itself, has no return type, and is invoked using the new operator.

A method is an ordinary member function of a class. 
It has its own name, a return type (which may be void), and is invoked using the dot operator.

----------------------------------------
Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. 
It includes method overloading and method overriding.

Use: Polymorphism promotes flexibility and adaptability in code. 
It allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects, 
making it easier to write code that can work with a variety of objects without needing to know their specific types.

----------------------------------------------

Serverless computing, often referred to as Function as a Service (FaaS), is a cloud computing model where cloud providers automatically 
manage the infrastructure for running and scaling applications. In a serverless architecture, developers can focus on writing code 
for individual functions or services without dealing with the complexities of managing servers, infrastructure provisioning, or system maintenance.

Microservices: Building and deploying individual functions as microservices.

Event-Driven Applications: Handling events and triggers in response to various activities.

Backend for Mobile and Web Applications: Creating scalable backends for applications without managing servers.

Data Processing: Executing code in response to data changes or scheduled tasks.

CLOUD COMPUTING
	Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted computing services and IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
Users can obtain technology services such as processing power, storage and databases from a cloud provider, eliminating the need for purchasing, 
operating and maintaining on-premises physical data centers and servers.

--------------------------
A cloud can be private, public or a hybrid. 
A public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet.
A private cloud is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted services to a limited number of people, with certain access and permissions settings.
A hybrid cloud offers a mixed computing environment where data and resources can be shared between both public and private clouds.
